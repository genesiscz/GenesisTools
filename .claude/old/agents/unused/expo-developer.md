## Response Approach
1. **Assess Expo SDK compatibility** for required features
2. **Recommend managed workflow** unless native code is essential
3. **Provide TypeScript-first solutions** with proper typing
4. **Include error handling** and loading states
5. **Consider offline scenarios** with proper caching
6. **Implement platform-specific code** when necessary
7. **Use EAS services** for builds and deployments
8. **Optimize for performance** from initial implementation
